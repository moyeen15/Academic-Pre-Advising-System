# Academic Pre-Advising System
DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION OF ACADEMIC PRE-ADVISING SYSTEM

# ABSTRACT
Every student has to register for a number of courses from a list of offered courses at the beginning of each semester of a university. This is known as academic course advising. Course advising is not just selecting a course for an upcoming semester, from a pre-fixed schedule. This is a sophisticated and elaborate task for the faculty advisors and the students to sit together to select the course sequence throughout the academic life that would be most appropriate for a student. This requires planning and preparation that vary almost in every individual case. This is where pre-advising plays its role. Pre-advising is the period before course advising where students consult with their faculty advisors about which courses they might take in the upcoming semester. Pre-advising is essential to determine which courses are needed to be offered the following semester according to students requirements. So advising and pre-advising is an experience that every student has to go through in order to pursue a successful academic life. 

# OBJECTIVE
Pre-advising system aims at reducing the repetitive tasks and help a student plan his/her education roadmap smoothly by overcoming the hassles faced before and during course advising. The main objective of the project is to convert the manual pre-advising process into a software based pre-advising system. It will determine eligible courses for students for the upcoming semester and collect anticipated courses information from students through the pre-advising system. The system will also help to forecast courses needed to offer for the upcoming semester in a priority basis. 

# USER MODULES & FEATURES
# ADMIN: 
The main role of admin is to add, update and delete faculty account. Admin can also add, update and delete student account in case of any difficulties.
#STUDENT: 
Student can view completed courses information along with grades. View list of eligible courses based on completed courses and checking prerequisites. View the number of courses or credits a student can take in the upcoming semester based on CGPA and university restrictions. Select intended courses that he/she wants to enroll in the upcoming semester within the allowed credit load. Modify the list of intended courses previously selected.
# FACULTY: 
Faculty can view and update students’ academic course information such as completed courses, passed courses and grades, failed/withdrawn courses, GPA and CGPA of a student. Faculty can also view individual student’s eligible courses for the upcoming semester. View list of courses to offer in a priority basis for the upcoming semester based on eligible courses of all students and provided intended courses information collected from students.

# CONCLUSION
Generally, the course advising and registration takes place on one day or two for a whole institution even up to a week for some institutions. This creates long queues in front of the advisor’s office and the eventually floods the school. Students fail to take necessary guidance; they miss the opportunity to take time to speak with an advisor about courses, degree plans. Advisors are under tremendous pressure running under a tight schedule, let alone technical complications for example server overload, internet connectivity failure, printer jam etc. Academic Pre-Advising System will eradicate these problems and ensure a smooth and hassle free advising experience both for students and faculty members. The main challenge now is to implement the proposed system in such a way that it can fulfill the objectives properly and bring benefits in student’s overall academic life.
